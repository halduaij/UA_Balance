```

## Installation

1. **Backup Original Files**: Always backup your original AI files before making changes
2. **Copy New Files**: Copy the enhanced AI files to your `ai/core/` directory
3. **Update Imports**: Modify your main AI files to import the enhanced systems
4. **Test**: Test the AI in a custom game to ensure everything works correctly

## Usage

### Basic Integration

To use the enhanced AI system, modify your `default.ai` file:

```lua
-- Import enhanced systems
import('Core/enhanced_cpu_manager.ai')

-- Replace the standard CpuManager with EnhancedCpuManager
function InitializeAI()
    player_id = AI_GetPlayerID()
    
    -- Use enhanced CPU manager instead of standard one
    cpu_manager = EnhancedCpuManager(player_id)
    
    if cpu_manager:Initialize() then
        Rule_AddInterval(AI_Think, 0.05)
        Rule_AddInterval(UpdateStats, 1+(cpu_manager.player_id-1000)*0.125)
    else
        cpu_manager = nil
        print("failed to load enhanced ai: "..player_id)
    end
end
```

### Configuration

The enhanced AI system uses a sophisticated configuration system:

```lua
-- Set difficulty level
EnhancedConfig:SetDifficulty("Hard")

-- Set race-specific configuration
EnhancedConfig:SetRace("space_marine_race")

-- Set map type
EnhancedConfig:SetMapType("small")

-- Get current configuration
local config = EnhancedConfig:GetCurrentConfig()
```

### Customization

#### Difficulty Levels

The system includes four difficulty presets:

- **Easy**: Conservative AI with focus on defense and resource management
- **Standard**: Balanced AI with moderate aggression and adaptation
- **Hard**: Aggressive AI with fast adaptation and complex tactics
- **Insane**: Maximum aggression with advanced micro-management

#### Race-Specific Behaviors

Each race has tailored behaviors:

- **Space Marines**: Tactical precision, defensive doctrine, elite unit focus
- **Orks**: Aggressive tactics, mass unit production, simple formations
- **Eldar**: High mobility, support unit focus, complex formations

#### Performance Tuning

The system automatically adjusts based on performance:

```lua
-- Get performance-adjusted configuration
local config = EnhancedConfig:GetPerformanceAdjustedConfig()

-- Monitor performance statistics
local stats = cpu_manager:GetPerformanceStats()
print("Strategy update time: " .. stats.strategy_update_time)
```

## Advanced Features

### Learning System

The AI learns from its experiences:

```lua
-- Record performance metrics
learning_system:RecordPerformance("resource_efficiency", 0.75)
learning_system:RecordPerformance("combat_effectiveness", 0.6)

-- Get performance averages
local avg_efficiency = learning_system:GetAveragePerformance("resource_efficiency", 60)
```

### Formation Management

Units automatically maintain formations:

```lua
-- Create a formation
local formation = formation_manager:CreateFormation(units, "wedge")

-- Update formations (called automatically)
formation_manager:UpdateFormations(delta_time)
```

### Threat Analysis

Advanced threat assessment:

```lua
-- Analyze current threats
local threats, total_threat = threat_analyzer:AnalyzeThreats()

-- Get threat patterns
if threat_analyzer.threat_patterns.has_spike then
    -- React to threat spike
end
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage

The enhanced system uses more memory than the original AI, but includes optimizations:

- Object pooling reduces allocation overhead
- Automatic cache cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Performance monitoring adjusts resource usage

### CPU Usage

The system is designed to be efficient:

- Configurable update frequencies
- Performance-based adjustments
- Caching reduces redundant calculations

### Recommended Settings

For optimal performance:

- **Low-end systems**: Use "Easy" difficulty with reduced update frequency
- **Mid-range systems**: Use "Standard" difficulty with default settings
- **High-end systems**: Use "Hard" or "Insane" difficulty for maximum challenge

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Performance Problems**
   - Reduce difficulty level
   - Increase update frequency in configuration
   - Monitor performance statistics

2. **Compatibility Issues**
   - Ensure all files are properly imported
   - Check for syntax errors in custom modifications
   - Verify Lua 5.1 compatibility

3. **AI Behavior Issues**
   - Check configuration settings
   - Monitor learning system adjustments
   - Review threat analysis results

### Debugging

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:

```lua
-- In utility.ai, set debug flags
g_bAITrace = true
g_bDebugMode = true
```

## Customization Guide

### Adding New Races

To add support for a new race:

1. Add race configuration to `EnhancedConfig.RaceConfigs`
2. Define unit role weights and formation preferences
3. Implement race-specific tactics if needed

### Creating Custom Strategies

To create custom strategies:

1. Extend the `EnhancedStrategy` class
2. Implement required abstract methods
3. Add strategy to the strategy coordinator

### Modifying Tactics

To modify unit tactics:

1. Extend the `EnhancedTactic` class
2. Override behavior methods as needed
3. Register tactics with the tactic coordinator

## Compatibility Notes

### Lua 5.1 Limitations

The system is designed to work within Lua 5.1 constraints:

- No `table.unpack` (use `unpack` instead)
- No bit32 library
- No integer division operator (`//`)
- Limited metamethod support

### Game Version Compatibility

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: More sophisticated learning algorithms
2. **Multi-threading Support**: Parallel processing for complex calculations
3. **Advanced Pathfinding**: Improved unit movement and positioning
4. **Predictive Analysis**: Anticipate enemy actions and counter them
5. **Team Coordination**: Better cooperation between multiple AI players

## Support
